/*Given two phrases , determine if one phrase is a permutation of the other.  The output should say "YES" if phrase 1 is permutation of phrase 2. Note that spaces/tabs/newLines are not counted as characters. Each phrase can be arbitrarily long and is terminated by the special string “ 0001”.  You can assume that " 0001" is not part of any phrase. Notice that there is a space in the beginning of the special string.

Input:
First line contains the T, number of test cases
Next follows phrase1 and phrase2 for all T test cases.

Output:
Print "YES" if second is a permuation of the first and print "NO" otherwise for each test case.

Example:
Input:
1
One World One Dream 0001
World One One Dream 0001

Output: 
YES
